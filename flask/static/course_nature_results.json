Who has the authority to narrate popular music, and how does popular music become a site of cultural heritage? Throughout this course, we will work with a notion of \u201cheritage\u201d as an act that brings the past into conversation with the present and can powerfully operate to bring people together while simultaneously excluding others or strategically forgetting. We will spend time with bottom-up heritage projects and community archives to better understand how memory is becoming democratized beyond large cultural institutions.

The clinical neuropsychologist uses standardized tests to objectively describe the breadth, severity and veracity of emotional, cognitive, behavioral and intellectual functioning. Inferences are made on the basis of accumulated research. The clinical neuropsychologist interprets every aspect of the examination (both quantitative and qualitative components) to ascertain the relative emotional, cognitive, behavioural and intellectual strengths and weaknesses of a patient with suspected or known (neuro)psychopathology. Findings from a neuropsychological examination can be used to make diagnoses, inform rehabilitation strategies, and direct various aspects of patient care. In this course, we will comprehensively explore the science and applied practice of neuropsychological assessment.",

What is its significance as a theory of change, a body of scholarship, and as a practice? This course explores how leading abolitionist and feminist thinkers theorize the state, punishment, criminalization, the root causes of violence, and the meaning of safety. It explores the historical genealogies of abolitionist thought and practice in relation to shifting forms of racial, gendered and economic violence. Students will analyze the works of formerly enslaved and free Black abolitionists, prison writings during the Black Power Era as well as canonical scholarly texts in the field. A central focus of the course is contemporary abolitionist feminist thought. The course is conceptually grounded in Black and queer feminisms, and features works by Indigenous, South Asian women and other women of colour.",

Addressing climate change, either in terms of mitigation or adaptation, is complex due to its pervasive scope, the heterogeneity of its impacts and the uneven distribution of responsibilities, resources and capacities to respond to it between different levels of government, stakeholder groups, and rightholder groups. This course focuses on nexus approaches in climate policy development and assessment across different public policy domains. In this course, students will learn about how different levels of government frame climate change and climate policy objectives, how they interact with stakeholders (e.g., economic interests and environmental groups) and rightholders (Indigenous people), and how to approach complexity in climate governance.",

The other is that a focus on questions related to women and gender further illuminate the complex relationship between food and cultural politics, variously defined.

Particular attention is given to intersections between sex, gender and other social locations and processes that impact health and health inequities across the lifespan, including the impacts of ableism, colonialism, hetero-normativity, poverty, racialization, and sexism on women's and men's health, and related health research and practice. Through course readings, case studies, group discussions, class activities, and course assignments, students will apply these theoretical lenses and develop analytical skills that : (1) advance a more contextualized understanding of gender and health across the lifespan, (2) provide important insights into gendered health inequities, and (3) speak to strategies and social movements that begin to address these challenges.",

Focus is on close readings of formative theoretical texts (for example, those by Bassnett, Lefevere, Pym, Venuti and others). Students will critically engage with significant translation theories since the late 1980s, analyse translations to identify how these theories function, and consider how they influence their own translation practice.",
